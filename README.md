# JupiterOutpostScripts
This repo contains the scripts used in my upcoming game Jupiter Outpost. A game built with Unity. Early build gameplay footage on [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/491862457).

This repository includes the script assets used in the game and does not include any project files or any other game assets required to build the game in Unity.
